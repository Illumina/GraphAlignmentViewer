# GraphAlignmentViewer:
Visualize the pileup of read alignments to a STR locus (or any path in the sequence graph) for one or more samples.
## Description:
  Genotyping STR loci is a difficult problem due to multiple reasons including flanks with similar genomic sequences, difficulty in aligning reads sequencing errors and sample contamination. ExpansionHunter is a tool that can automatically predict the genotypes of STR loci based on read alignments. However, due to the difficult nature of the problem, there may be errors in the predicted genotype. GraphAlignmentViewer, is a standalone Python3 script that creates a visualization of all read alignments to an STR locus to enable visual inspection of the genotype predictions made by ExpansionHunter. The script can visualize one or more samples, including trios to compare genotype calls in multiple samples. For each sample the script requires genotypes predicted by ExpansionHunter in BAM format for EH version 3 or YAML format for EH version 2.5.

The image generated by GraphAlignmentViewer displays alignments of reads to a modified reference genome. The modified reference corresponds to sequence of the STR genotype with the largest count for each repeat unit in the realigned BAM file from ExpansionHunter. As a result, the modified reference and aligned reads are (vertically) sectioned into consecutive STR and non-STR regions (graph nodes).  Next, GraphAlignmentViewer groups all aligned reads from a sample into (horizontal) blocks. Each block consists of all reads with a unique STR count for the selected repeat unit. Within each block, GraphAlignmentViewer displays the sequence of modified reference in the top row. This is followed by the aligned sequences of reads with the corresponding STR count. This grouping allows a user to quickly compare and count all similar reads to each other as well as identify difference with the modified reference. Insertions and deletions are denoted by "^" and "-" symbols respectively. If reads from multiple samples are provided, then the reads from each sample are simply stacked vertically from top to bottom. Finally, GraphAlignmentViewer displays the genotypes reported by ExpansionHunter and the locus structure in the title of the plot.

Of note, if the STR is longer than read length, then the sample would contains reads aligned completely inside the STR region (in-repeat reads). In such a case, the modified reference corresponds to the smallest genotype with whole repeat units larger than the read length. In case of a large repeat expansion, the user will be able to observe a block with large number of in-repeat reads aligned to the section corresponding to the expanded repeat unit. Read alignments that span the STR are displayed in a left-aligned fashion. Non-spanning read alignments that overlap the STR are either left-aligned or right-aligned depending on whether they also align to the left flank or the right flank.


The image generated by GraphAlignmentViewer displays alignments of reads to a modified reference genome. The modified reference consists of the STR sequence long enough to accommodate alignments of all reads together with the sequence immediately flanking the repeat. The repeat sequence is separated from the flanking sequence by vertical lines.

Read alignments are grouped into horizontal panels/blocks that either overlap or completely span the number of repeat units indicated on top of the panel. For example, if a sample contains a short allele consisting of five repeat units then the plot is expected to contain a panel with alignments of reads spanning exactly five units. Repeat alleles that are much larger than the read length correspond to panels depicting multiple reads completely contained within the repeat (analogously to pileups corresponding to copy number variant, the more such reads there are, the longer is the corresponding allele).

Insertions and deletions are denoted by "^" and "-" symbols respectively. If reads from multiple samples are provided, then the reads from each sample are stacked vertically from top to bottom. Finally, GraphAlignmentViewer displays the genotypes reported by ExpansionHunter and the locus structure in the title of the plot.



**Note:** The current version only supports graph specifications consisting of linear paths and self-loops, but not branching nodes.

## Usage:
`python3 GraphAlignmentViewer.py --help`
### Use case 1: Single sample
`python3 GraphAlignmentViewer.py --variant_catalog VARIANT_CATALOG --read_align READ_ALIGN_FILE [--gt_file GT_FILE]`
### Use case 2: Comparison of genotypes from multiple samples
`python3 GraphAlignmentViewer.py --variant_catalog VARIANT_CATALOG --read_align_list READ_ALIGN_FILE_LIST`
## Requirements:
* Python3
* Matplotlib
* Pysam
* Numpy
* PyYAML (if visualizing output from versions older than v3)
## Inputs:
### Common inputs:
1. `VARIANT_CATALOG`: Path to variant catalog JSON file used to run ExpansionHunter
### Use case 1: Single sample
1. `READ_ALIGN_FILE`: Read alignment file generated be ExpansionHunter. BAM for v3, YAML for v2.5.
2. `GT_FILE` (optional): VCF or JSON output of genotype calls from ExpansionHunter
### Use case 2: Comparison of genotypes from multiple samples
1. `READ_ALIGN_FILE_LIST`: A 2/3 column text CSV file containing the list of EH output for all samples:
* Column1: Sample name,
* Column2: Read alignment from EH output similar to `READ_ALIGN_FILE`,
* Column3 (optional): VCF or JSON file from EH output

The pileups for the samples are shown in the order reported in the input file.  
**Note:** If the paths to the read alignment BAM/YAML and VCF files are not absolute, they are chosen relative to the location of the sample list file.

## Outputs:
The script produces 1 file per repeat unit or `NODE_GROUPING`: `<OUTPUT_DIR>/<CHROM>-<START>-<REPEATUNIT>.alignment.png`. If the `--pdf` flag is set then it produces the file `<OUTPUT_DIR>/<CHROM>-<START>-<REPEATUNIT>.alignment.pdf` instead.

If the flag `--output_prefix` is set then the output file name is `<OUTPUT_DIR>/<OUTPUT_PREFIX>_<CHROM>-<START>-<REPEATUNIT>.alignment.png` or `<OUTPUT_DIR>/<OUTPUT_PREFIX>_<CHROM>-<START>-<REPEATUNIT>.alignment.pdf`
